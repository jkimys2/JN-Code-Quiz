# JN-Code-Quiz

## Description

Through this challenge, I was able to create a quiz using JavaScript. This quiz includes multiple-choice style questions as well as a timer. This challenge was completed by following these acceptance criterias:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
